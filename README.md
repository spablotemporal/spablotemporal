### Sup y'all 🖖🏼

I'm Pablo (he/him), I like science and math. I currently work as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Center for Animal Disease Modeling and Surveillance](https://cadms.vetmed.ucdavis.edu) at UC Davis. I am interested in the application of complex systems to infectious disease dynamics, specifically in the development of tools that facilitate decision making, science communication and accessibility.
